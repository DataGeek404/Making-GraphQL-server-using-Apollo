// This code defines a Sequelize model for a User entity.
// It imports the DataTypes object from Sequelize and the sequelize instance from the db.js file.
// This model represents a user in the system. It has two fields: name and email.
// The name field is a string that represents the user's name, and the email field is a string that represents the user's email address.
// The model is defined using Sequelize, which is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for Node.js.
// Sequelize allows you to interact with your database using JavaScript objects instead of writing raw SQL queries.
// The User model is defined using the define method of the Sequelize instance.
// The first argument is the name of the model, and the second argument is an object that defines the fields of the model.
// The DataTypes object is used to define the data types of the fields.
// In this case, both fields are defined as strings using DataTypes.STRING.
// The User model is then exported so that it can be used in other parts of the application.
// The User model can be used to create, read, update, and delete users in the database.
// The model can also be used to define relationships with other models, such as posts or comments.
